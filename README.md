# Scanpy Use Cases and Tutorials

Start of with one of the examples below, but the following templates might be helpful: [myexample_template.ipynb](myexample_template.ipynb) and [preprocessing_template.py](preprocessing_template.py). Many examples, as compiled [here](EXAMPLES.md), can be called directly from the command-line.
Analyzing *10x Genomics* data sets from [Zheng *et al.*, Nat. Comm. (2017)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14049), we find that Scanpy is about a factor 5 to 10 faster and more memory efficient than comparable R packages such as [*Cell Ranger*](https://github.com/10XGenomics/single-cell-3prime-paper/tree/master/pbmc68k_analysis) and [*Seurat*](http://satijalab.org/seurat/) [(Macosko *et al.*, Cell 2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.002). For large-scale data, this becomes crucial for interactive analysis.
* 170503 ([link](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy_usage/tree/master/170503_moignard15.ipynb)) - Diffusion Pseudotime Analysis resolves developmental processes in data of [Moignard *et al*, Nat. Biotechn. (2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3154), reproducing results of [Haghverdi *et al.*, Nat. Meth. (2016)](http://10.1038/nmeth.3971). Also, note that DPT has recently been very [favorably discussed](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/21/110668) by the authors of [Monocle](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/articles/v2.0.0/).
