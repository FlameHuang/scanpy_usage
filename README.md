# Scanpy Use Cases and Tutorials

Start of with one of the examples below, but the following templates might be helpful: [myexample_template.ipynb](myexample_template.ipynb) and [preprocessing_template.py](preprocessing_template.py). Many examples, as compiled [here](EXAMPLES.md), can be called directly from the command-line.

* 17-05-05 | [link](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy_usage/tree/master/170505_seurat) | We reproduce some of the recent [Guided Clustering tutorial](http://satijalab.org/seurat/pbmc-tutorial.html) of [*Seurat*](http://satijalab.org/seurat/) [(Macosko *et al.*, Cell 2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.002).

* 17-05-03 | [link](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy_usage/tree/master/170503_zheng17) | Analyzing 64 000 cells from [(Zheng *et al.*, Nat. Comms. 2017)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14049), we find that Scanpy is about a factor 5 to 10 faster and more memory efficient than the optimized [*Cell Ranger*](https://github.com/10XGenomics/single-cell-3prime-paper/tree/master/pbmc68k_analysis) pipeline. For large-scale data, this becomes crucial for interactive analysis.

* 17-05-01 | [link](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy_usage/tree/master/170501_moignard15/notebook.ipynb) | Diffusion Pseudotime analysis resolves developmental processes in data of [Moignard *et al*, Nat. Biotechn. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3154), reproducing results of [Haghverdi *et al.*, Nat. Meth. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3971). Also, note that DPT has recently been very [favorably discussed](https://doi.org/10.1101/110668) by the authors of [Monocle](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/articles/v2.0.0/).
